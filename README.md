# Password-Manager

This project generats OTP for password manager. The password manager will be requiring OTP for login purpose. If it’s correct it will display all the passwords we have stored in it. It has following operations.


UI  Elemets: These are the core visual elements which the user eventually sees and interacts with. For the UI we will be using Java Swing and Greenfoot. 
Encryption: The more popular and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm likely to be encountered nowadays is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).


The features of AES are as follows −
•	Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
•	128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
•	Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
•	Provide full specification and design details


Decryption: The process of decryption of an AES ciphertext is similar to the encryption process in the reverse order. Each round consists of the four processes conducted in the reverse order.
•	Add round key
•	Mix columns
•	Shift rows
•	Byte substitution



OTP Generation : For OTP generation we have used TOTP(Time Based One Time Password). A time-based one-time password (TOTP) is a temporary passcode, generated by an algorithm, for use in authenticating access to computer systems.
